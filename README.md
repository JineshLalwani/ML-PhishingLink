# ML-PhishingLink
We aim to conduct research and compile results to identify any potential spam or phishing attempts within the data.

We check if the entry contains any keywords related to sensitive information such as "password", "username", "social security number", or "credit card". If any of these keywords are found, we flag the entry as a potential phishing attempt.
Also if the entry contains any urgent language like "urgent", "immediate", or "action required". If any of these words are present, we flag the entry as a potential phishing attempt.
While we're not explicitly checking for solicitations in the code, the presence of urgent language and requests for sensitive information can often be indicative of solicitations commonly seen in phishing attempts. However, if you have specific keywords or patterns you want to detect for solicitations, we can include that in the analysis as well.
